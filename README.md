# Amp Sender
OSC sender of sound amplitude for Hydra

## Why Amp Sender?
Ever tried to use an audio input (e.g. virtual audio cable) when live coding in Hydra? The only default possibility is to use the built-in microphone of a computer, also with addition of the desired input. Using only one external input is impossible - so I decided to code an OSC sender for UDP/WebSocket (with which Hydra receives OSC messages), possible to use when creating audio-reactive visuals in Hydra.
